# password manager app using Tkinter

This app generates strong passwords that can be used when signing in to sites.
When the app generates the password, there is no need to copy it, it will already be available on your clipboard. 
Just paste it!
Passswords are saved in a file called "data.json" which will be created new when one runs the app from the start.
Previous passwords can be searched from the app
